# Election Timer

Countdown timer that displays the number of days between today and the next US presidential election on November 3, 2020. There is also a color-coded "gauge" and "needle" that shows where the current day stands between the presidential election days in 2016 and 2020.

Calculating time difference gets confusing with numerous time zones, regionally-observed daylight savings times, and leap years. This timer uses UTC times to make (hopefully) easy to understand "apples to apples" calculations. It then adjusts those results based on local times.
