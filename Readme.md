Countdown timer that displays the number of days between now and the next US presidential election on November 3, 2020. There is also a color-coded graph with "needle" that shows where the current day stands between presidential election day 2016 and presidential election day 2020.

All functionality is accomplished through "vanilla" JavaScript. To calculate the number of days, Universal Coordinated Time (UCT) is used as a baseline, then accommodation is made for local time. The "String substr()" method is used to add a comma to the number of days if over 999. Absolute positioning and adding a value to the "left" "position" property positions the needle.

To avoid confusion for others - you may see the terms Universal Coordinated Time (UCT) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) tossed about and wonder what is the difference in time between the two? There is no difference.
